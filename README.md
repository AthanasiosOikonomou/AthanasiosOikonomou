### Hi there! 👋 I'm Athanasios Oikonomou

🚀 I'm a passionate software developer with over 3 years of experience in the field. Currently, I'm delving into the realms of software development, exploring the intricacies of various technologies.

💻 **Languages & Technologies:** Deluge, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Node.js, React, Python, Postman, and a strong advocate for writing clean code.

🌐 **Expertise:** I specialize in building robust REST APIs and seamless integrations. As a lead developer, I've successfully navigated through multi-year projects, honing my skills in project management and team leadership.

🧠 **Philosophy:** I believe in the power of clean code, meticulous validations, and thoughtful flow design. There's no substitute for well-thought-out solutions.

🌱 **Constant Learner:** I thrive on the principle that "There's no growth in the comfort zone and no comfort in the growth zone." Every day is an opportunity to learn something new and improve.

🏋️‍♂️ **Beyond the Keyboard:** When I'm not crafting code, you can find me working out at the gym, boxing, enjoying the serenity of nature, or spending quality time with my four-legged friend.

📈 **Let's Connect:** Open to collaboration and always excited to connect with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out for discussions, projects, or just to share insights!
